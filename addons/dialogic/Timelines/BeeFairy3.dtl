BeeFairy: That flower patch is doing it's best to produce pollen for the hive, but it might be better if it had some friends. A couple other flower patches next to it will make a big flower garden that can produce lots of pollen for us!
BeeFairy: Bees are pros at growing new flowers. All you have to do is have them drop a couple pollen puffs on an empty space, wait, and poof! FLOWER MAGIC!!
