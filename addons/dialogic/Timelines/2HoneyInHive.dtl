BeeFairy: STOPPP!!!! DON'T TOUCH THAT HONEY!!!!
BeeFairy: ahem. sorry. All I meant is that you're about to witness something MAGICAL!! If you leave that honey there, the bees will make a new little worker bee! And your little colony can keep growing!!
BeeFairy: Ugh, sorry, I just get so excited about this sort of thing. I'll stop talking your ear off for now, and we can keep working hard to grow our garden!! Well, not literally talking your ear off. I'm not sure how that would work. Maybe there's some sort of magic involved? How cruel.. could you imagine!? 
BeeFairy: Okay, um, for real now.
