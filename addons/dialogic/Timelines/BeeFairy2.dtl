BeeFairy: AAAAAA! Look at that beautiful [color=palegoldenrod]honey[/color]! Doesn't it make you just wanna fly around in circles? Good work, little guys!
BeeFairy: OKAY, this is the best part. Now that you have 2 [color=palegoldenrod]honey[/color], you can make a new [color=palegoldenrod]hive[/color]! All they need is an empty space, far enough away from the other [color=palegoldenrod]hives[/color]. The colonies don't like to be too close to each other, you see.
BeeFairy: It makes them all confused. They're all like, 'bzzzz!!!! bzzz!!! bzz!!!'\

[To build a new [color=palegoldenrod]hive[/color], transport the [color=palegoldenrod]honey[/color] to an empty space.]
BeeFairy: You can also use [color=palegoldenrod]honey[/color] to multiply your [color=palegoldenrod]bee[/color] population! Leaving 2 [color=palegoldenrod]honey[/color] in a [color=palegoldenrod]hive[/color] overnight will attract a new [color=palegoldenrod]bee[/color]. [color=palegoldenrod]Bees[/color] are all about [color=palegoldenrod]honey[/color], y'know. It's like their bread and butter. Or like, their bread and [color=palegoldenrod]honey[/color]. Well... you get what I mean.
