Narrator: Once upon a time, a lonely fairy wandered through the woods, lost and with nowhere to go.
Narrator: She came upon an oak tree, standing tall and alone. Though it was old and withered, she felt as if she could see it as it once was-- proud and kind, giving life and protection to all that grew below it. 
Narrator: Underneath the tree, her heart brimmed with newfound comfort. She decided to use the little magic she had to restore the garden, and the tree that watched over it, to a thriving ecosystem.
