class_name InteractableTile
extends GridObject

# InteractableTile are GridObjects that can change/exchange resources
# from Slots during an interaction.


# look.  it also weirds me out that there's no code here anymore.
# it needs to exist cuz UIManager/Player use it to categorize what all
# they're working with.  is there a better way?? probably.  does this
# way make the most sense for the time being though?  yeah, also probably
